#### Extracting Stacking Structure Pattern of Educative 4DBlock Material Utilizing Deep Learning


##### 🧠 Project Overview
This project implements a deep learning-based approach for extracting stacking structure patterns from educational 4D block materials. By defining 10 types of building structures and applying multi-label classification with EfficientNet-B3, the model is trained to recognize complex stacking patterns. To enhance interpretability, Grad-CAM is used to visualize model predictions.

- `Note`: The training dataset used in this study cannot be provided.

- The model architecture and training code can be found in the `train/` directories.

- The `streamlit/` folder includes a simple interface where you can try real-time inference using a sample image or a webcam with actual 4D blocks.
